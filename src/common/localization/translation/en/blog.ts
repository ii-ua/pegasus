    title: 'Why Is the Pegasus Arms 25 Resistant to Electronic Warfare?',
    paragraphs: [
      '“YOUR DRONE WILL BE TAKEN DOWN BY THE FIRST EW SYSTEM!”, — say those who only saw UAVs on social media and confuse Pegasus Arms 25 with completely different drones.',
      'In reality — no.',
      'It does not lose control and does not “fall into the field” when exposed to EW.',
      'Why is the Pegasus Arms 25 resistant to electronic warfare?',
      '➡️ FREQUENCY AGILITY: operates across a spectrum of frequencies that are difficult to track. If a signal is jammed, the drone automatically switches to another frequency.',
      '➡️ STRONG ENCRYPTION: the protected control channel prevents interception or enemy interference.',
      '➡️ PILOT SUPPORT: even in powerful EW zones, the drone maintains control and continues performing tasks under interference.',
      '➡️ MISSION ADAPTATION: before each flight, the system adjusts to the threat type, terrain, and level of electronic interference.',
      'The goal is not just to launch the drone — but to ensure it completes the mission and returns.',
      'Pegasus Arms 25 is a strike UAV that has successfully done so dozens of times.',
